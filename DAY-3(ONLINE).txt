VAPT :VAPT VULNARABILITY ASSESSMENT AND PENETRATING TESTING
MA

VAPT:
v is a state where there is a possibility of being attacked or harmed

VA and PT are two different services produces different results but focuses on same area

VA examines websites weather vul present or not

PT if present how much impact ...


HYDRA is used to perform bruteforce available in linux
used in systems ,servers

VA is used to find existing key vulenarabilities(loop holes) ,configuration issues(new router bought ),that gives the way to the attacker to enter into system 
VA might gives wrong results
VA is a non intrusive process (dosnt harm target system) .we find pre existing loopholes
Automated testing tools such as web or network scanners are used
It prioratizes the loopholes based on the security
It categorize the loopholes  found into differnet categories
1)critical(dark red) -> Dangerous 
2)high(light red)
3)medium(yellow)
4)low(green)
5)informative(blue)
At the end of VA a report is generated by which PT is done
PT confirms the vulnerabilities
using gateway from cmd(ipconfig) paste it in chrome go to chrome type default username pass 
sir ip 192.168.1.112


PENETRATION TESTING:
It is an in deapth  analysis i.e driven by the experts.We check weather the loop holes really exist or not reported by VA
We check the impact of loophole
It is an

DDOS attack website limit 10lak 5cr requests to website website down
VA gives a website gets effected by DDOS 
It is a intrusive process where it infrastructure may get damaged.
shows how damaging a flaw could be in real attack
Mannual testing least use of tools
PT website people to test  
outcome of PT will be generated in the form of screenshot,videos and log called proof of concept


VAPT phases of hacking
Footprinting and Reconnaissance: gathering of information as much as possible from the target such as ipaddress,os version,emply details
Scanning : we take the ip address and put it in the scanner it finds the loophole
gaining access : based on loopholes found in scanning we gain the access
maintaining access : install some malicious programs that will give access to give complete access to server by installing malicious backdoor which helps him in entering again without above steps again
clearing track: clear log details



blackbox pentesting: company dont give any kind of testing max info they give is ip just to know how good their server is they want to know what a real hacker can do to their website
whitebox pentesting : they give complete inforamtion 
greybox pentesting : company give ip,os details,services, and user accounts ,api documentation


Assignment : CIA TRIAD

VMWARE INSTALLATION 


Before going into the CIA triad what is computer security..?

THE protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objrctives of preserving the integruty availability confidentiality

confidentiality :otherts should not understand ie encryption. prevention of unauthorized access.protecct the data that is transmitted b/w sender and reciever

    ex : requesting the details from bank to mail on the fly the data is secure and confidential only accesed by me

Integrity : reciever must recieve the complete message by the sender there shold be no modifications by the hackers ,i.e making sure there is no data loss and data must be kept uptodate

availability : making sure the server is available all the time


Confidentiality:is roughly equivalent to privacy. Confidentiality measures are designed to prevent sensitive information from unauthorized access attempts.
 It is common for data to be categorized according to the amount and type of damage that could be done if it fell into the wrong hands. 
More or less stringent measures can then be implemented according to those categories.

Integrity: involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle.
 Data must not be changed in transit, and steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorized people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality).

Availability: means information should be consistently and readily accessible for authorized parties. 
This involves properly maintaining hardware and technical infrastructure and systems that hold and display the information.
