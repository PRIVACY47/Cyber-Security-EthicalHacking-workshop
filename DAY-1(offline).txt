2)script kiddies:  knowledless they dinst lnow any thing they catck teenageres they use them as a target


categories of hackers::

three types

coderes :: they are the gods of thechnology who build everything

admins :: they maintain all the tools developed by coders but they dont know how to build 

script kiddies :: they dont have any kind of knowledge they learn then and there like following a utube vids.they dint have knowledge abt the impact of what they do

differenc between active and passive attack

active attack: if a attcket make attack and the victims make notice of that that 
passive aattck: if attacker make aattack anfd make sure he donta cones under the notice of that victims




vm ware 

virtualization:

hyperviser :: technology useful to run multiple operating systems parallely
ex for hyperviser : vmware work station ,virtual box


why we need to run virtual :: caz it destroys the sofeware so we make work in os in virtual machine so the virtual machine gets destroyes and our main brach is safe




system hacking

bruteforce  (methodology) 
wordlist   types dictionary wordlist,rainbow wordlist


bruteforce : thechniqe used to password cracking wwhixh uses dictionary rainbow table wordlist by checking the probability to get required pssword 
              uses trail and erro r method with possible alpha numeric and special charecters 


what is word list..?

dictionary wordd list :: having simple and possible posswards slow in cracking password

rainbow woed list : encrypted content

where the passwords are stored in windows ..?

It is in the sam file  location: C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM
sam stands for security accounts manager 

where password storesd in linux its in etc file
passwd user accounts
shadow 


plain text is converted into hash and then matched with the hash contents in the sam file
 

change the password with out knowing the previous password

net space is an utility  command available in the windows.net space is useful in changing the password in the windows


net user 
net user username password

if the user name is having  space then mention it in the double quote 

limitations cannot know the the previous password

prevention dont give the administration rights to the user fron which we are using


windows password cracking using OPH cracking


oph crack is an open source tool which we can get it from the interner which we acan get it from internet .iso format


fiels that which run out of the os are called boot software
.exe is a runnable can run with in the system


rufus is a usb bootable software

go set usb as primary in boot options


drawbackd takes lot of time
if password is alphanumeric then it is very difficult


by passong the passwod by using the kon boot


disable usb ports and keep password to the boot


network

ip is a unique address for identification
these are static and dynamic

public and private ip 

classification of ip address(research)

a rourte is kept in a public place and it can generaate 1-255 ip  address

proxy and vpns

to surf the internet anonumously
prxys are slow and vpns are fast 

prxys aare less secure and vpns are more seecure 

proxy uses  more interenet 
 
proxy means using of different ip address

vpns ::

browser based and syasyen based vpn 

hide my ass bouncing vp
 

find locaron using ip address



spoofing 

spoofing is a situation in which a person or progran sucessfully masquerades as naother by falsifying data to gain 

1)mac spoofing 
2)call spoofing(crazy call.net)
3)sms sppfing
4)email spoofing(emkei.cz)

change mac address tmac

to know mac address cmd :: getmac /v /fo /list


social engineering :

pishing website:::: pishbat

there are fout types of social engineering


kali linux have more than 600 hacking tools which is used to penetration testing

seeker github

git clone 
linux kernel

python seeker.py -p 1337

ngrok is used to make a stable ip address 

./ngrok http 1337
